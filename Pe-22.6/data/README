Each dump file: id xu yu zu vx vy vz  
 - id = atom ID 
 - xu,yu,zu = unwrapped atom coordinates
 - vx,vy,vz = atom velocities
 - total 553M (553 megabytes)
It's a moderately large file (additional space is required). If you have enough storage to download each dump file (To avoid running the parallel simulation again), please contact k.gonzalesflores@fisica.ugto.mx.

Each velocity-angular.data contains: 
# wx wy wz w Lxx Lyy Lzz
or 
#additional seed to improve statitics of msdra curve (more points for the linear fit)

Each msd-rotational.data contains:
# t MSDRA
